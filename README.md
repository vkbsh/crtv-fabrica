This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability and stability of the project, we use testing. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework for our Next.js application.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
# or
bun test
```
